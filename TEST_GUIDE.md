# 🧪 Testing Drishti Agent With Pantry Image

## What Your Image Shows

Your uploaded image contains:
- **📦 Disorganized inventory** - Products scattered randomly
- **🏪 Poor shelf utilization** - Wasted vertical & horizontal space
- **🔀 Mixed categories** - No clear classification system
- **❌ Inefficient layout** - Difficult to find items

## Expected AI Response

When you upload this image, Drishti Agent should analyze:

### Problem Identification
- **Title:** "Inefficient Inventory Organization in Retail Storage"
- **Severity:** HIGH / CRITICAL
- **Category:** Inventory Management & Operations
- **Impact Areas:** 
  - Customer service (hard to find items)
  - Staff efficiency (restocking takes longer)
  - Space utilization (wasted shelf real estate)
  - Loss prevention (products out of view)

### Optimization Plan
The AI will suggest:
- **ABC Analysis Model** (categorize by sales volume)
- **Space allocation optimization** (high-margin items at eye level)
- **Reorder point calculations** (prevent stockouts)
- **Layout restructuring** (create logical zones)

**Expected Impact:**
- 40-50% faster restocking
- 30-35% better space utilization
- 25% reduction in inventory loss
- 20% improvement in customer satisfaction

### Implementation
- Archive system tech stack
- Dashboard for real-time inventory tracking
- Barcode/QR code system design
- Mobile app for staff scanning
